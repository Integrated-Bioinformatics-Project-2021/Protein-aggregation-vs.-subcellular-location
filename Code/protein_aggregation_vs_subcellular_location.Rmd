## Exploratory analysis

### -- Co-occurrence Matrix --
This function gives the number of proteins that are shared by different subcellular locations.

If relative = **FALSE**, the absolute number of shared proteins is displayed.

If relative = **TRUE**, the ratio of the intersection to the union of the two subcellular locations is shown multiplied by 10000.

### Interpretation:
We see that most of the
