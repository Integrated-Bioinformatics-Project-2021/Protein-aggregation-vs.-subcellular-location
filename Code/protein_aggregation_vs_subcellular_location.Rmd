## Exploratory analysis

### -- Co-occurrence Matrix --
This function gives the number of proteins that are shared by different subcellular locations.

If relative = **FALSE**, the absolute number of shared proteins is displayed.

If relative = **TRUE**, the ratio of the intersection to the union of the two subcellular locations is shown multiplied by 10000.

### Interpretation:
We see that most of the proteins that are located in the nucleus are also common for the cytoplasm as a subcellular location. Cytoplasm also shares common proteins with cell membrane. Co-occurrence plot seem to be in line with the general pattern of protein locations. For example: It is most probably expected that if protein is located in the nucleus then it will also be in the cytoplasm (transcription factor).

```{r}

### Interpretation:
Heatmap can be checked to see the significance level for the difference in the average score of different subcellular locations. All things considered, when significance is checked with respect to the mean, we see that only 3 subcellular locations are not significant according to the test.

```{r}
plot_average_tango_scores_complete_proteins()

### Function Documentation:

**plot_average_tango_scores_APR_proteins_joined_secreted**: Generates the violin plot for all of the proteins with APR regions according to their subcellular locations. However, this time all APR proteins are clustered under secretory and non-secretory groups. Red points are showing the mean value of Tango Score for these categories.

## Statistical tests and visualisation on secretory vs. non-secretory

### Function Documentation:

**plot_normalized_number_APR_regions_joined_secreted**: Generates the violin plot for number of normalized APR regions for all the proteins according to their subcellular location. However, this time all proteins are clustered under secretory and non-secretory groups. Red points are showing the mean value of Tango Score for these categories.

```{r}
plot_normalized_number_APR_regions_joined_secreted()
significance_secretory_nbAPR(normalized_number_APR_regions)
plot_stat_significance_nbAPR_secretory(normalized_number_APR_regions)
```

# Peptide charges

This part of the analysis is not considered. Still, explanation of the function is as follows:

**classify_subsets**: Get the subset of the APR proteins depending on the definition of the residue (GK, distal region, flanking region, APR region). We define different subsets to filter the data depending on the residue category.

```{r}
source("charges.R")
classify_subsets()
```

Defining the variables depending on the filtration method of the whole data.

```{r}
# TODO: make plots showing the differences between APR, GK and FR based on charges
# TODO: see if differences when split into subcellular locations

# protein_sequences_APR_peptides = get_charge(APR_peptides)
# protein_sequences_GK_peptides = get_charge(GK_peptides)
# protein_sequences_FR_peptides = get_charge(FR_peptides)
```

If this analysis is not done, delete the following variables to speed up the memory

```{r}
rm(APR_peptides)
rm(GK_peptides)
rm(FR_peptides)
```

# Pie Plot for the residues

postive charged aas ("positive") --> R,H,K <br /> negative charged aas ("negative") --> D,E <br /> uncharged aas ("uncharged") --> S,T,N,Q <br />  special cases aas ("special") --> C,G,P,A  <br />  hydrophobic aas ("hydrophobic") --> V,I,L,M,F,Y,W

**Specific residues of interest**

Lysine (Lys) --> K <br /> Arginine (Arg) --> R <br /> Aspartic acid (Asp) --> D <br /> Glutamic acid (Glu) --> E

```{r}
source("gatekeeper.R")
```

## Only for the GK regions

**analyse_gate_keeper_regions**: General analysis of all proteins for only GK regions

```

### PERCENTAGE OF ALL RESIDUES FOR ALL OF THE GK REGIONS IN ALL PROTEINS

**barplot_percentage_of_all_residues**: Function to plot the percentage of all residues in the GK regions of all proteins.

```{r}
barplot_percentage_of_all_residues(GK_analysis$cts_gk, "GK REGIONS")
```
### PERCENTAGE OF ALL RESIDUES FOR ALL OF THE GK + FL REGIONS IN ALL PROTEINS

**barplot_percentage_of_all_residues**: Plots the percentage of all 20 residues for every protein. Considers the residues in the GK and flanking regions.

### Interpretation:
We have more abundance of specific residues when we only consider the percentage of the amino acids in the GK regions. However, when percentages are calculated for residues that are also in the flanking regions, we see that higher percentage of some residues are dropping to the average level instead of increasing or remaining still. This indicates that GK regions indeed have some preference for specific residues. These residues are mostly the charged amino acids.

```{r}
barplot_percentage_of_all_residues(GK_analysis$cts_gk_fl, "GK + FL REGIONS")
```

### PERCENTAGE OF ALL GROUPS OF RESIDUES FOR ALL THE GK REGIONS IN ALL PROTEINS

**barplot_percentage_of_all_residues**: Occurrence of the residues in GK region depending on the category of the amino acid.

### Intepretation:
We see very little preference for hydrophobic residues since the whole purpose of GK regions are assumed to be preventing the aggregation of proteins with other hydrophobic regions.

```{r}
barplot_percentage_of_all_residues(GK_analysis$cts_gk_groups, "GK REGIONS")
```

### PERCENTAGE OF ALL GROUPS OF RESIDUES FOR ALL THE GK + FL REGIONS IN ALL PROTEINS

**barplot_percentage_of_all_residues**: Occurrence of the residues in GK + FL region depending on the category of the amino acid.

### Interpretation:
When flanking regions are included, percentage of these groups of residues gets closer to average probability which is 20%

```{r}
barplot_percentage_of_all_residues(GK_analysis$cts_gk_fl_groups, "GK + FL REGIONS")
```
